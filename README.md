# Conway's Game of Life

Just a simple project implements the famous
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
with nothing but Python's builtin libraries. The interface is inspired
by [this website](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/). This is also a practice
of designing a GUI application that follows the MVP architecture.

## Requirements

* Python3 (with **Tk** configured)

## Run

```
$ python3 -m game_of_life
```

## Test

```
$ python3 -m unittest
```
