# Conway's Game of Life

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/johnliu55tw/game-of-life.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/johnliu55tw/game-of-life)

Just a simple project implements the famous
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
with nothing but Python's builtin libraries. The interface is inspired
by [this website](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/). This is also a practice
of designing a GUI application that follows the MVP architecture.
